      of: Dropdown.ItemIndicator,
      description:

## Usage

### Default

<Canvas of={stories.Default} />

### Controlled

Use `value` and `onValueChange` props to control the value of the dropdown.

<Canvas of={stories.Controlled} />

### Controlled open state

Use `open` and `onOpenChange` props to control when the dropdown is opened or closed.

<Canvas of={stories.ControlledOpenState} />

### Disabled

Use `disabled` on the root component to disable the dropdown entirely.

TODO

### Disabled Item

Use `disabled` on individual `Dropdown.Item` to disable them.

<Canvas of={stories.DisabledItem} />

### Groups

Similar to `optgroup` HTML tag, you can gather your items in groups.

It is important to use `Dropdown.Label` inside each `Dropdown.Group` to give it an accessible name.

<Canvas of={stories.Grouped} />

### Item indicator

Renders when the parent `DropdownMenu.Item` is selected.

You can style this element directly, or you can use it as a wrapper to put an icon into, or both.

<Canvas of={stories.ItemIndicator} />

### Trigger leading icon

Use `Dropdown.LeadingIcon` inside `Dropdown.Trigger` to prefix your trigger with an icon.

<Canvas of={stories.LeadingIcon} />

### Read only

TODO

## Multiple selection

When using `multiple` mode, the component manages an array of values and no longer a single value.

It means you must adapt `value`, `onValueChange` and `defaultValue` accordingly.

In `multiple` mode, the dropdown won't close when the user selects an item, and it is possible to unselect every item.

### Default

<Canvas of={stories.MultipleSelection} />

### Controlled - multiple selection

Use `value` and `onValueChange` props to control the value of the dropdown.

<Canvas of={stories.MultipleSelectionControlled} />

## Advanced usage

### Custom item

If your `Dropdown.Item` contains anything else than raw text, you may use any JSX markup to customize it.

**If you do so, you MUST use `Dropdown.ItemText` inside of your item to give it a proper accessible name.**

<Canvas of={stories.CustomItem} />

### With form field label

<Canvas of={stories.FormFieldLabel} />
